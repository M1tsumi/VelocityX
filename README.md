Lock-free data structures, done right and explained like you've never seen. Zero locks, blazing fast, actually correct. MPMC queues, hashmaps, work-stealing deques, skiplists: all with deep docs, diagrams, assembly breakdowns, and Loom proofs. No guesswork, no subtle bugs. Just fast, safe concurrency you can finally understand.
